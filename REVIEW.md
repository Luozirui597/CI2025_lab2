# Review

Documentation comments should appear inside the function's body, not before it and only one should be present per function. Overall the code looks correct and seems to yield good results, I really like the patience mechanism you implemented. I added a `pyproject.toml` for easier dependency management and ease of creation of a new virtual environment (`uv sync`).
